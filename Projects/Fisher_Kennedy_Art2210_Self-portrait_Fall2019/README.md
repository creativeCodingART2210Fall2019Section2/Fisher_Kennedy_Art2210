The artist I chose to reference is French artist Malika Favre. This photo was part of her project called Hide and seek where it consisted silhouettes of pure minimalism and pop art, but sometimes described as Op Art, and for some of you that don’t know, like I did, Op Art is the use of color and shape to create a sense of movement or an illusion of some other object in front of the viewer’s eyes. Malika develops this style by using positive and negative space and color, especially of the female body like it is shown here. My original goal was to create a variable where I can have the background, the face, and perhaps the lips changing into different colors, and to also have the eye either move left to right or to have the eye waggle repeatedly to show some movement.
After ten days trying to formulate a code, I eventually gave up with that idea and opted for something less difficult. So, the three functions I used were function setup, function draw, and function window resized. For the function setup I chose a size that would be equivalent to the size I created my self-portrait in adobe illustrator. I found the coordinates for that by simply viewing document setup and did the same for creating the shapes of the face. For the background, I wanted to keep my original idea and have the background changing color and for that, I created a Hue variable. I wanted to do the same for the face, using a hue variable, but instead created a color variable using RGB. What’s showing for the face was a complete accident but decided to keep it because it gave an interesting affect towards my self-portrait.
